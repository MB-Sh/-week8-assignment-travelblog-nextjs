Reflection Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.

Required 
🎯 What requirements did you achieve? 

I was able to display all posts on the page, with an option to sort them in ascending or descending order.

Created a SQL schema for a posts table and a comments table, with the comments being connected to the posts table with a foreign key.


I added a delete button on comments that allows users to delete the comments from the database.

Created a form which saves comments to a dedicated comments table, with the comments being connected to the posts table with a foreign key.

I was able to allow users to comment on individual posts in their dynamic routes. 

Add a redirect when a user creates a post to redirect them to the posts page.

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve? 
The stretch goals.

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks? 
I particulalry found it hard adding comment, because it require using "api/route" but I found a lot of resources in the Next.js website particullay helpful.
